Putting this file here because ill forgot tomorrow. The multiplyVec is wrong, its trying to multiply a 4x4 matrix by a 1x4 vector 4 matrix.
This causes the math to be done incorrectly. A possible fix is to make the matrix like the following

[[x, 0, 0, 0],
[y, 0, 0, 0],
[z, 0, 0, 0],
[1, 0, 0, 0]]

But ill have to play with it a bit
